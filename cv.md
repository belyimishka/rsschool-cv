## About me

I want to learn a new profession. I am 49 years old. I understand that I need to move on, learn something new and promising. I worked in social security and in a bank, so the profession of a front-end developer seemed the most suitable for me. I'm starting from scratch, I know it's hard, but it is worth it.
