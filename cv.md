I want to learn a new profession. I am 49 years old. I understand that I need to move on, learn something new and promising. I worked in social security and in a bank, so the profession of a front-end developer seemed the most suitable for me. Do not sit still and wait for heavenly mana. I take and do. I start from scratch, practice and knowledge - zero. I know it's hard, but it should be worth it.

There are no skills for this profession.
